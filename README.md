# TCP server and TCP client.


## TCP server:
TCP networking is typically used for programs that require every piece of data to be sent and received in sequence. It also ensures that the client receives the data and sends a notification to the server.

## TCP client:
Before we can run the client program, we must first run the server program that we created. Then build and run the client program. After opening the program, click on the "Connect" button. After successfully connecting to the server, type a word in the edit widget located at the bottom and press the send button. This time the display window will appear with the word you wrote.

Go to the server program to check if anything printed on the terminal window.
